        <div class="article">
        <article><p>I am Rupanjan Saha, a passionate and driven first-year student at Kalyani Government Engineering College, currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. With a strong foundation in engineering principles, I am eager to explore the intersection of technology and innovation.

            Beyond my academic pursuits, I have developed a keen interest in web development. I have hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently learning JavaScript to enhance my web development skills. I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in this area and contribute to building interactive and dynamic websites.
            
            I am always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow. Whether it's through personal projects, online courses, or hands-on experience, I am committed to honing my skills and making meaningful contributions in the tech field.
